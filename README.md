# Automatic_chicken_door

This is a repository for a small project I'm making.
This project inteds to automatically open a door to the new chicken coop. This would happen with 4 x AA batteries whilst using the lowest possible power consumption.
The scope of this project is not to go too indepth, a simple solution with minimalistic design is good enough for the purposes that we are trying to achieve.
